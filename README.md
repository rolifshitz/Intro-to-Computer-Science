# Intro-to-Computer-Science
This repo contains assignments that I coded for my first computer science course in university.

In this course, I focused on:
\* Translating problems into code using *modular design*
\* Unit testing
\* Creating interactive systems that allowed for user input
\* Recursion
\* Complexity analysis

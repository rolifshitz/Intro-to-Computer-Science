# Intro-to-Computer-Science
This repo contains assignments that I coded for my first computer science course in university.

In this course, I focused on:
* *Translating problems into code using modular design*
* *Creating interactive systems that allowed for user input*
* *Reading in and writing to files*
* *Unit Testing*
* *Recursive Algorithms*
* *Searching & Sorting Algorithms (i.e., Quicksort, Mergesort, etc.)*
* *Complexity analysis*

# Intro-to-Computer-Science

## About This Repo
This repo contains assignments that I coded for my first computer science course in university.

In this course, I focused on:
* *Translating problems into code using modular design*
* *Creating interactive systems that allowed for user input*
* *Reading in and writing to files*
* *Unit Testing*
* *Recursive Algorithms*
* *Searching & Sorting Algorithms (i.e., Quicksort, Mergesort, etc.)*
* *Complexity Analysis*

## Setup
Projects in this repo were created with:

```Python version: 3.5```

To run an assignment, simply go into the assignment folder and run the `InputDriver.py` script. This will jump start the program corresponding to this assignment.

Before running `Assignment 1/InputDriver.py`, please install the *NLTK* package using the instructions found [here](https://www.nltk.org/install.html). It is recommended, although not necessary, to use an Anaconda Environment. Installation instructions for Anaconda can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html), and instructions for creation of a new environment can be found [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands).
